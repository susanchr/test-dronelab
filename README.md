## Drone Dashboard 


The Application was built using React (a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces) and Node JS (an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment). It provides the users an interface to connect with drones and provide services like aerial surveillance, inspection of infrastructures, first responders coordination, geothermal exploration, etc. The dashboard also provides the users with statictics on drone operations and other drone related information to effectively monitor, optimize and control the drones.

Drone technology has massive overlaps in key technology advancements in the recent years. Drones are major talking points in Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, visual analytics and more. In addition to being pivotal instruments in these technologies, drones have a multitude of use cases.

This subset of a table published by the IDC's Worldwide Robotics and Drones Spending Guide Taxonomy, 2020 report describes Public Market Use Cases and many <B>Additional Operations</B> described in this lab.

Among possible uses for drones equipped with visual recognition:

Firefighters can attach thermal imaging cameras to a drone and immediately see where the hotspots are in a forest fire.
Search and rescue teams can use them to look for heat signatures to find someone lost in the wilderness.
Farmers can use them to determine the health of crops and make decisions affecting crop yield.
Surveyors can create a 3D visualization of a construction site as the structure is being built.

These are just a handful of use cases that drone technology, edge computing and cognitive analysis are used for. These use cases are focused on the Public Market and can be expanded to many other industries.
