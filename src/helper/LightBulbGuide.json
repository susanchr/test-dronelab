            "text":"As Stormwater Management operators attempt to assess risk during a weather event, it is vital that they be able to leverage drone imagery and other camera views in each area of concern (i.e.: vehicle & foot traffic areas, low water crossings, previous flooding hotspots).  These views can help validate information from other sources (i.e.: sensors alarms, weather alerts, citizen reports) and allow the operator to make informed mitigation or response decisions with a better understanding of the physical situation.   With the power of IBM Maximo Visual Inspection (MVI), a model can be trained to identify objects and patterns from these camera views and videos that further deliver insights to the operator.  In this Stormwater Operations Monitor interface, our application has made requests for the various video sources to the custom-trained MVI model API via secure gateway from the IBM Cloud SBaaS, and then processed the detected objects results into an analytic overlay on the video.  These detections were used to generate alerts when there were ”dangerous” conditions present in the video/image, based on rules and thresholds in the application.   By having these access to the video and analytics from a single solution interface, the operator can compare the video output with alerts from other sources, check geospatial context, and devise a mitigation/response plan with support from guided workflows, predictive models, and virtual support."

    "alerts":{
        "title":"Alerts",
        "text":"Stormwater Management operators rely on Alerts to proactively raise awareness of relevant information from other sources/systems, and it is important that they be able to have visibility into the details from a common interface.  It would be typical during a weather event for there to be alerts reported to the command center by police, fire, city personnel and/or citizens.  Alerts are also generated by other systems  or services that should be available within the same interface, such as weather and traffic.  With IBM Maximo Visual Inspection, analyzed images can be an additional input to proactively notify when there is anomaly detected in a camera image/video.  Finally, Maximo Monitor and its associated IoT Tool can generate insights from a city’s network of sensors to report on measurable conditions (i.e.: weather, water/stream) when they fall outside of defined risk thresholds.   Even predictive models that monitor conditions from multiple sources can trigger an alert based on the presence of other alerts.  By considering alerts from all these sources in one interface, the operator can quickly assess each alert, compare with video sources and geospatial context, and devise a mitigation/response plan with support from guided workflows, predictive models for  recommended actions, and virtual support."

    "location":{
        "title":"Location",
        "text":"One of the best ways for operators to achieve full situational awareness of an unfolding situation is by considering the geospatial context.  As storm event is approaching,  with a map-based view Stormwater  Management command center operator can monitor the current location of incidents,  alerts, weather,  and waterways, as well as city resources such as remote responders, drones/cameras, and infrastructure/equipment.    As the operator assesses each alert  and looks for validation from video sources, they can then refer to the map to determine the proximity to other alerts or resources in that area that might then allow them to devise a mitigation/response plan.   Geospatial context is also an important factor in predictive models, which uses historical information to forecast risk when evaluating current conditions and thus can pinpoint areas  might soon be vulnerable as the weather situation unfolds."

    "actions":{
        "title":"Actions",
        "text":"Just as important as monitoring video sources, assessing the risk of all alerts, and considering geospatial context,  it is important that Stormwater Management operators also have the ability to plan and execute mitigating response actions without having to jump into different tools/interfaces.   Guided “next step” actions, virtual agent support, recommended actions can all be valuable inputs for the operator to reference to help provide consistency in response and to take advantage of insights from historical data captured about past events and actions in this area.  Coordination tools like Intelligent Dispatch allow the operator to choose the most appropriate responder easily based on filters that consider location, availability, and equipment, and can help capture communication between operator and responder that leads to improved reporting and post-event evaluation.​"
